# Codility Lessons In Python

I have created this repository to save my answers to the Codility lessons as I might want to revisit them at a later date.

If you stumbled upon this repository and want to have a look at the way I went about solving the problems, go right ahead. 

If you have come up with a more elegant way or a more pythonic way to solve a specific problem, please get in touch as I am always keen to learn new things and improve.
